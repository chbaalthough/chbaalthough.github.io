Projects
======
* **English Go:**  
  An intelligent vocabulary learning app that breaks the traditional sentence-memorizing paradigm. It customizes story scenarios based on users’ interests and abilities, building a fun, personalized learning bridge. With AI, each word is uniquely tailored for every user. Features include dual-driven interest/ability, scenario-based learning, multimodal content generation for individual/confusing words, scenario-driven story creation, and image-based text generation, helping learners efficiently and enjoyably master English vocabulary.

* **XinXuan ZhiTao:**  
  This project aimed to enhance keyword search effectiveness on shopping platforms like Taobao, JD.com, and Alibaba by bridging the gap between keywords and images. I led front-end design, built the database, and used the BlueLM-7B model to generate keyword-to-image outputs, fine-tuning it with a 3,000-entry dataset.

* **The Voice of Forbidden City Cultural Relics:**  
  Enhanced user experience by building digital humans based on relic images, enabling dialogue and storytelling about artifacts, letting relics, history, and culture "speak" to users.

  An educational software that supports basic path testing, path coverage testing, and GPT-based testing. It helps beginners grasp confusing test methods through auto-generated flowcharts and test cases, and allows hands-on exploration of LLMs in software testing.

* **NewsRhythm (ZhiYun):**  
  This system leverages deep learning for real-time news broadcasting and intelligent dialogue. It enhances efficiency with PaddlePaddle and Whisper, ensures fluent interaction with ERNIE-4.0-8K, and features text-to-speech, voice tone conversion, smart conversations, and weather forecasting.
