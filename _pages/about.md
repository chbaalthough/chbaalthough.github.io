Hello, I am Wang Bingqian. I obtained my bachelor's degree in Broadcasting and Television Engineering from the Communication University of China, and later pursued a second bachelor's degree in Software Engineering at Peking University. This interdisciplinary academic experience has provided me with a well-rounded knowledge structure and the ability to approach problems from multiple perspectives.

I am skilled at identifying and articulating problems in everyday life, and I enjoy applying what I’ve learned to solve real-world challenges. For example, I noticed that searching for the right product during online shopping was time-consuming and that long keywords often failed to match items accurately, so I collaborated with a classmate to design “XinXuan ZhiTao,” an intelligent product selection tool (see CV for details). While preparing for the IELTS exam, I found traditional vocabulary memorization methods tedious and inefficient, which inspired me to develop “English Go,” an intelligent vocabulary learning app. Most recently, when I struggled to teach my grandparents to use smartphones, I conceived the idea of creating a senior-friendly app—“Digital Descendant” (see related PDF).

My aspiration is to develop software that truly understands and cares for its users. I also look forward to joining an inspiring team, progressing together, and exploring more possibilities!
